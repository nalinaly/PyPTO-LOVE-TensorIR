# CHECKPOINT

**Checkpoint:** `CP-0000`

**Status:** R0 started; no compiler or model milestone accepted.

## Current truth

- The control repository was initialized in
  `/home/zhaosiying/pypto-love-tensor-ir`.
- The implementation and upstream checkouts have not yet been materialized.
- The local target is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, SM120, 24,463 MiB.
- CUDA Toolkit 13.3 is installed under `/usr/local/cuda-13.3`; the installed
  PyTorch is 2.13.0+cu130.
- Prior reconnaissance did not complete a TensorIR SM120 runtime launch. Static
  target support is not runtime acceptance.
- Protected zcode work was active at R0 start. No heavy PyPTO task may begin
  until the live safety preflight is green.

## Resume action

Run `python tools/preflight.py --mode light`, inspect the protected-process
report, then continue only the unchecked R0 items in `TODO.md`.
